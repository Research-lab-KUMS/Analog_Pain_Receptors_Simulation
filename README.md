# Analog_Pain_Receptors_Simulation
Functional Simulation of Pain Receptors
Robotic data were colected and stored in ".xls" files, in the next step, robotic data converted to ".p" files to simulate nuerons in Cadence. Finaly, spike trains were analyzed in the Python V3.6 and classified using machine learning packages.
